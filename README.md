Water depth estimation

We compared three methods for estimating flood water depth from satellite derived water extent and digital terrain model. The results were validated against hydrodynamic modelling results from 11 river reaches in three Australian regions. The best performing method is Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (Cohen et al, 2018). This study provides a guideline for future studies that enhance remote sensing-based flood maps with water depth, making use of the growing number of publicly available remote sensing water extent and digital terrain datasets globally.
